        <p>Seeing the picture makes me think of some games I played, it seems like Resident Evil and Death Space.I began
            to play the kind of game when I was...I forgot it. What I can remember is initially I watched some of my
            classmates play, and then I got lost in the game. Every one and then, I would think of that game.</p>

        <p>When I grow up, I find it not that chanllege to play those ghost games, even when it is midnight.I can recall
            when I played The Last of
            us 2.It was a midnight, I controled Aily to combat the final boss Rat King, nerverously and thrillingly.
            Computer games to some extent do give
            us a unique sensation where we can totally forget about the pressure of the reality and have a momentory
            indulgence.
